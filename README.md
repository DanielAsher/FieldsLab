Swift experiments with SKFieldNode

Created with XCode Version 6.0 (6A215l)

Example using the following SKFieldNodes with Swift in iOS8:

- spring
- radial gravity
- drag
- vortex
- noise
- turbulence
- electric*
- magnetic* 

NOTE: As of this writing it seems magnetic and electric fields are broken
